# Zark City

This is a single-player only version of [the board game](http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/zark-city) which was designed for use with [Looney Pyramids](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids)

# TODO
* Move pieces to different locations
  * drag to card and insert into list
  * handle > 4 different pieces on a card
    * I don't expect this to come up very often.
      * Would "pages" on cards be acceptable?
        * overloaded cards would have buttons to swap out which pieces are visible
      * Alternately, an overcrowded card could pop up a window with a scrollable list
* text rendering with `rusttype`
* gameplay
